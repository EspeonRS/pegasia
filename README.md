# Pegasia
What would have been the open-source Old School RuneScape client.

Pegasia is a client I have worked on irregularly over the course of the last year. What it has currently in terms of features isn't really all that much, but I had intended it to be a lightweight, open-source client with a similar feel to SwiftKit. So no overabundance of reflection features, just basic tools to help improve the user experience.

As of this morning, using a 3rd party client (except one in particular) has become a high risk for receiving a macroing ban. My close friend who has played for around 10 years has been temporarily banned for using this client.

As such, I am no longer going to work on this client. The state it is in is workable, but it is not nearly as far as I would have liked before a public release. I had hoped to create a more dynamic user interface to allow panels to be swapped between locations, as well as outside of the main client window. I was also planning to add some basic security features so external plugins couldn't take out a user's system.

Using this client, as well as any other 3rd party client (except one in particular) has a high chance of being banned for macroing, so I would advise against actually playing the game with it using an account you value.
