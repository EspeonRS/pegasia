# pegasia
Source code of what may likely be a discontinued OSRS client.

The source is not 100% the same as the build that my friend and I used to play, but all the underlying methods used to load and run the game should be the same.

I hadn't made any progress on the client in about a month, as I was about to start reworking the UI but have been too busy with other things.

Unless the situation with the mass bans is resolved, I am going to cease development of the client.
